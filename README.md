# Workshop-4

Here I started practising building website headers using plain HTML and CSS.

This project is a small single-page static site where I experiment with creating and styling a header section (logo/image, navigation, and basic layout).

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-4

## Features

- Single-page static website (`index.html`)
- Header section built with semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Basic navigation layout (menu structure for future links)
- Custom styling in a separate stylesheet (`style.css`)
- Local image asset (`download.png`) used in the layout (e.g. logo or decorative element)
- Pure front-end: no JavaScript, no backend

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Getting Started

You only need a web browser.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-4.git

# Go into the project folder
cd Workshop-4

├── download.png   # Image asset used in the page
├── index.html     # Main page with the header layout
└── style.css      # Styles for the header and page
