# Workshop-4

This repository contains the fourth workshop project by Burdulaa.  
It builds on previous workshops and introduces additional features, structure or styling based on the project goal.

## Project Overview

- A multi-page static website (or single page with enhanced features) using HTML and CSS  
- Improved layout, design tweaks and possibly new assets or content  
- Pure front-end: no backend server or database required  
- Designed to run in any modern web browser

## Features

- Navigation between pages (e.g., home, about, contact, gallery)  
- Structured folder layout (for assets such as images, stylesheets)  
- Shared stylesheet (and maybe modular CSS) for consistent design  
- Use of semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)  
- Responsive design (if included) for mobile and larger screens  
- Basic interactive elements (optional) such as hover effects, image galleries, or transitions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- (Optional) A lightweight static server for local testing (e.g., `python -m http.server`)
